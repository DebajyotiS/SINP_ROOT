1) Navigate to the directory where the root file is saved

2) Load your root file by starting a root session with :
 root - l "filename.root" (without the quotation)

3) If your root file has subdirectories inside which the relevant Tree exists, simple navigate to the directory. You can
do this with TBrowser : 
 TBrowser b;

 This will open up a dialog similar to your file explorer. Simply navigate to the relevant subdirectory and note the Key for the Tree. 

4) 'key' -> MakeClass("Myclass") (Type the key value without quotation)

5) This will create a Myclass.C and a Myclass.h file.

6) You are now ready to write macros. Open up your .C file.
